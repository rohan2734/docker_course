`sending built context do docker daemon 155 MB`

why are wee seeing it now, when we havent seen it before?

issue is :
we have just installed `create-react-app tool` and 
used it to create the project, that tool automatically installed 
all of our dependencies in our project 

it has 155 mb of dependencies

in the past, we didnt install any of the dependencies, instead 
we were dependent on docker to install the dependencies 

so at present , we have 2 copies of dependencies and we dont need 2

we will delete the node modules folder in working directory

and now if we try to build the image a second time 

using `docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .`

we will notice that it was much faster 

when we were putting the node server with docker
