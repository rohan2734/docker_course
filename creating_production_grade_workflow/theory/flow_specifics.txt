* in the last section, we discussed the development of a development 
workflow that is going to  allow us to develop a application,
 test and deploy it and repeat that process 

* creating a github Repo , it is a centerpoint of coordination for 
all the code which we are going to write, and deploy to outside hosting 
service

* it is going to have two different branches
 - feature branch : (development branch) add code, make changes, and update the applicaiton 
 - master branch : represent clean working copy of code bits 
 - any changes which we are going to make on master branch,
  will automatically get deployed on  the hosting provider 

* pull all the latest code from the feature branch 
* make some amount of changes in the application, push those changes 
  and again to the feature branch 
* once you push the changes to feature branch, you will create a pull 
  request , and merge them over to the master branch 

* this pull request to add code from feature to master, is going to set off 
   a series of actions that governs how we manage your code bits 

* once the pull request is created and merge it, 2 important things occur 
  we are going to setup a workflow , that is going to automatically 
  take our applicaiton and push to a applicaiton called Travis CI 

* travis CI pulls down the code, and runs the set of tests, taht you write on 
  your code base

* for our applicaiton , we will make some pregenerated tests 

* Travis CI , automatically take our entire project and push to amazon 
  webserver hosting
