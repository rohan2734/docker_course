Development

Docker container 
npm run start 
-----
in production 

docker container 
npm run build 
-----

we are going to create 
`Dockerfile.dev`

and purpose of dockerfile.dev is to make sure that 
it is really clear that this dockerfile is only used to run our 
applicatoin in Development environment 

and in production ,
it will only have the name of `Dockerfile`

otherwise during the production it would build the image of 
`Dockerfile.dev` (instead) in frontend folder , otherwise it cant find package.json 

---

( write a different configuration to create image similar 
start with base image )
FROM node:alpine 

( mentioning the current working directory )
WORKDIR '/app'

( copying the package.json to current working dirctory of app )
COPY package.json ./ or COPY package.json .

( install the dependencies )
RUN npm install 

( copy everything  from the project )
COPY ./ ./ or COPY . .

CMD ["npm","run","start"]

---
`cd fronted`

now we will figure out to run a dockerfile with 
custom filename 

run `ls` , we see the dockerfile

and run `docker build .`
but we get an error message saying that dockerfile is not found 

so inorder to make sure we build the project with `Dockerfile.dev`

we are going to make little change with `docker build .` command as 
`docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .`

`f` is for mentioning the file 

--
now it is going to load up the dockerfile,
and create image  

we might see a couple of warnings here 

that is fine,
