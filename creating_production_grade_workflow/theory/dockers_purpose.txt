* last flow didnt mention about docker 
* docker is a tool in a normal development flow 
* docker makes some of these tasks a lot easier 

* we might see that the focus is not on docker, 
  and more on AWS,github etc , that is fine 
* we are going  to see how docker can be 
  implemented 

* Application we are going to make ,is going to have 
  no custom code, we are going to generate a project ,
  (using little project generator),we are going to wrap that up 
  with inside of a docker container
