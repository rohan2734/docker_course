* after running 
    `docker build Dockerfile.dev .`

    we need to run copy the id and run it by 
    `docker run sha256:a20c974906beb84be1c2dfdbed8673`

* when we run it , we see our development server startup    
 and we can access the development server , by  http://localhost:3000

* we see that the site is not reached 

* anytime we want to expose our port to docker 
we need to add `-p` to map out the port 

* docker run -p 3000:3000 a20c974906beb84be1c2dfdbed8673

* we are going to see the development server ,
and we see the page 

* now we are going to make changes 

* change the "edit src/app.js" to "hi there"
* save that , and refresh the page, we dont see the changes 

* when we start our image, we are taking a snapshot of all
of the source code inside of our project directory
and we are builing the snapshot with that  image 

* if we want the changes to be shown, we need to rebuild the image 
or figure our some clever solution 

* ofcourse we dont want to rebuild the image, 
* next seciton we are going to see the changes automatically getting 
mapped to the image
