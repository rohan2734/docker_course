>docker start contianerid
* to see the information, or output from the contianer, we added "-a"

>docker logs contianerid

>docker create busybox echo hi there
contianerid
>docker start contianerid ( it executes hi there inside of it and immediately exists)

* now we want to go back to the stopeed contianer, and we want all logs from that contianer
>docker logs contianerid (get logs from a contianer)
(docker logs is not re running the contianer again, we are just getting the logs of the contianer )

* it is a good way to inspect the contianer
