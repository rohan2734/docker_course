with the flow of actions that occured while we are building a image 

we spoke on how 

we can create contianer from image, and we can take a container 
and generate image out of it also 

we can manually do this that docker file does 

so run these:

docker run -it alpine sh

apk add --update redis

docker ps ->to get the id of the running contianer

4753a07a6b5e

docker commit -c 

(-c allows us to specify the default command )

docker commit -c "CMD 'redis-server'" 4753a07a6b5e

output is the new id of the image : sha256:003478a41a933f2b5e529e34cbb5968298e98ddcf27940825d674ac339af8469

you can copy the segment of the id 

docker run 003478a41a9
