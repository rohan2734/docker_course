creating a docker file is like 

installing chrome on a computer with no Operating System

How do you install chrome on computer with no Operating System ?

install an Operating System   -
start up your default browser - sepcify a base image 

navigate to chrome.google.com -
download installer -
open file/-
execute chrome_installer.exe -run commands to install additional programs 

execute chrome.exe -command to run on startup 


when we created an image, it is empty, there is nothign to install
 any dependency
the purpose to sepcify  a base image is to give a starting point
five initial set of codes, that we can use to further customise our image 


From(Instruciton telling docker server what to do) -Alpine(argument to instructino) 
Run- apk add --update redis
CMD - ["redis-server"]

why did we use Alpine as base image?
 why do you use Windows or macos ?
 we use so that it has built in terminals that is nice for us 
 or it has set of pre installed programs that are useful for us to accomplish 

what is it?

APK - (nothing to do with docker) it is a program called  apache package,... 
it is a package manager ,that comes pre installed on the alpine image 

we can use that package manager that is built into alpine to automatically download redis for us
we used alpine because it has package manager program which has already built for us
