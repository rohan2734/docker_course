docker build .
builds the image , and returns the id : sha256:ae73da6b2cfd85cbde708d3dea5ca3339e0

we can build a container from it
docker run sha256:ae73da6b2cfd85cbde708d3dea5ca3339e0

an instance of our image will get a new container, and inside that 
we are going to have the insance of redis server 

docker run id is a pain 
we had done docker run redis ,remembering the name 

so we are going to reun docker build and we are adding a little argument 
that is going to  tag the image that is created, and make it lot easier 
to refer to it by a name that we can customise  

convention is 
your docker id / name of the project : version 

-t  stephengrider/redis:latest

-t rohandevaki/redis-server:latest .
. -> specifies the directory of files/folders to use for the build 

so now you can  enter the command 

docker run rohandevaki/redis

you dont need to specify latest 

latest version will be used by the docker
