everything started from alpine instruction
FROM apline image 
it told the docker server to download alpine image

we used alpine image as a base (since it comes with handy programs that 
are useful for us to create images  )

RUN apk add --update redis 
instruction was exectued by docker server 

get image from previous step 
it was used to create a temporary container 

command specified was executed in the temporary container, it downloaded
and installed redis in that and modified the FS 

it took a snapshot of container FS , and result was FS snapshot 

and we got image ready for the next instruciton, that image is the FS snapshot 

shut down the temporary container 

we are passing alpine image with redis added on top to the next instruction

cmd ["redis server "]
then we again create  image from the previous step 
create a temporary container out of it 

rahter than  executing the run command, we run the CMD command 
to specify what the image should do , when it is started as a container 

it will execute the command ["redis-server" ]whenver it starts on future 

and result was container , that has modified primary command 

we shut down the temporary container and get image ready for the next instruction
