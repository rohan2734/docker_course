docker build .

it takes docker file and creats an image 

it is a new command tied to the CLI

when we run docker file, we give it to docker client ,turns 
and gives file to
docker server, and builds usable image 

. is specifying build context ->set of files and folders that 
we want to wrap in this container 

FROM alpine -> it looked at local cache ,and checked to see ,
 if it has ever downloaded an image called alpine before 

* we just download an initial image 

* step 2 -> RUN apk add --update redis

we created a temporary container from alpine image , 
we executed this command inside the contianer, and we took the container File System
and saved it as a temporary image , we have temporary file system snapshot 
that has redis included 

with CMD -->["redis-server"]

it will check the previous step , we create a new temporary container out of it 
and we make the image file system snapshot and stuff into the other container 

CMD setting primary command of the primary process of the container, 
container doesnt execute the redis server , it just tells the container
if you were to run real, you should be running with redis-server as primary command

and shuts out the other command, takes the snapshot of File system and primary command  
end result is successfully built id
