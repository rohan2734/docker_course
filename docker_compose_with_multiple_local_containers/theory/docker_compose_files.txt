* here are the containers i wanted to be created

1.redis server - make it using redis image 
2. node-app - make it using dockerfile in current directory 
            - map port 8081 to 8081


in the same directory , create a new file 

docker-compose.yml 
and we are going to write all that configuration
here 

----
version: '3' //that specifies the version of docker compose which we are trying 
            //to use this formatted file 

//telling docker what we wanted it to do 
//anytime you see services is container 
//it is not exactly a container, but we can say that it is a type of container
//in the above example, we are defining 2 services
//both these services take the form of docker container 
services: 
//first service 
    redis-server:
        //specify the image to create the container 
        image: 'redis'
    node-app:
        //here we are going to mention the dockerfile , instead of image 
        //so we are going to mention build : .
        //look in the current directory for a dockerfile 
        //and use that to build the image 
        build: . 
        //specify the ports
        ports:
        // - in yml is an array, we can specify an array of ports 
        //we only want to map one set of ports 
        //syntax -> "port on local machine : port inside the container "
            - "4001:8081"

next section, is how we bring up this yml file to bring the containers 
together
