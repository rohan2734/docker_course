docker container contains web application 
that is number of times someone vistied the server 

we need 2 seperate components to build this 

we need web server to respond to http requests, 
and to render the xml 

we also need database to store the number of times it is visited 
we use redis it is in memory database 

the number of times the page has been visited 


we are going to make a single container, we can run both 
node and redis 

however we get a lot of traffic ,
 we need to introduce more web application
servers to respond to incoming http requests 

so inorder to make additional servers, we need to create additional 
instances of docker container that contains both node application and 
instance of redis 

the issue is 
everyone of these redis servers will be disconnected 
so one redis instance might think that the page might be visited 99 times 

and other instance can think that it might be vistied only 3 times 

so we cannot create multiple redis instances for a single app 
instead we want one signle instance

so we will have seperate docker containers which has node app 
will conenct to one single docker container with redis 

in first iteration we will not be considering about scaling
