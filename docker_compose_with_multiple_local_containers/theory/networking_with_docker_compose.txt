we havent established any network between the two 
containers 

by just defining these services, docker compose will automatically
create the services on same network 

and we are going to have free access to communicate with each other 
in any way we want 

but how to connect nodejs to redis ?
start working in index.js 

---

const app=express();
// () here we are going to add the location of the redis server 
// we are running, to specify, 
// we specify { host : 'connection-url' }
// since we are using docker compose here, we can conenct to the 
// other contianer  , running the redis server  ,simply by 
// redis-server
// but expressjs doesnt have any idea of redis-server 
// redis server is not going to assume that we sent some url with https 
// when the connection request goes out , from this node application 
//docker is going to see it 
//and it sees the container with the name redis server 
//so it is going to get automatically redirected 

const client = redis.createClient({
    host : 'redis-server',
    port : 6379 //by default redis uses this port 
});
