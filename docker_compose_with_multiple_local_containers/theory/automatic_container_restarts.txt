* we are going to figure our , how docker compose can restart the crash
 or stopped container 

* index.js file, we added process.exit(0) 
this 0 refers to exit status code 

status codes 
0 - we exited and everything is OK 
1,2,3 etc - we exited because something went wrong 

--

we are going to setup a restart policy
inside our docker compose file 

"no" - by default we have no restart policy assigned to all 
of the containers
meaning- do not attempt to restart this  container, if it stops or crashes 
"always" - this container stops "for any reason" , always attempt
to restart it 
"on-failure" - only restart if container stops with an 
error code 
"unless-stopped" - always restart unless we (the developers) forcibly
stop it 
---

add 
    node-app:
        restart: always

change to 
    restart: on-failure

hit ctrl+C to stop the running process  and 
run `docker-compose up`

here when we check the localhost:4001  , we exited 
with code 0
we have not got any error 

here the contianer will never restart 

if we want to use `no`

we need to use as ` "no" ` or ` 'no' `
and not just `no` 
since yml file `no` is interpreted as `false`

example of always
is to run a public web application 

worker proces
processing a file, then let it close out ,and not get restarted
