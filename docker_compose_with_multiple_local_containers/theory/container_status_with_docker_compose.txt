docker-compose ps 

it will print the status of the two containers inside the docker compose file 

we need to run the docker-compose as the same directory of 
docker-compose.yml file 

when you run docker-compose ps 
it will look for docker-compose file inside of your current directory

if it finds one,it will read that file, and try to find all the running 
containers on local machine that belong to the docker compose file 

if you run from any other directory, it will not be able to find the containers
