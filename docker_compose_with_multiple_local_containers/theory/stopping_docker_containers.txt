two different commands to how to run them 
with docker compose 

1. in past we executed by 
`docker run -d redis`

this started a new container, but it executed in 
the background 

2. print all the running containers 
`docker ps`

3.stop  that container 
- copy the id 
- `docker stop id`

4. launch in background 
- `docker-compose up -d` 

5. stop containers 
- `docker-compose down`

---

since we made changes on one of our images 
we need to add build that again 
so we use 

docker-compose up --build 

after running it , we are going  to rebuild the container 

and then everyhthing starts up and redis server would be running 
and node also  

now if we open up the web browser , 
we see an error message, and if we see the terminal ,it says 
we exited with code 0 

open the second terminal , and run `docker ps`

and we see that only redis server is running, and node server is no longer 
running

and we want  to automatically restart it , at some point of time
