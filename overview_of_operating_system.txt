*  most os has kernel
* kernel is a running software process , that governs access between all the programs running on the computer
    and all the pyhiscal hardware as well
*  ex: nodejs, directly doesnt communicate with the physical device 
* instead nodejs, comminicates with the kernel, as in "it wants to write a file" 
  and then the kernel comminicates with the cpu,memory and the hard disk.

* namespacing: isolating resources per process ( or group of processes)
    ex:processes,harddrice  ,network
* control groups( cgroups) ,limit the amount of resources used per processes
    ex: limit, the memory, cpu usage, network bandwidth


* a coontainer is not a pyshical construct that exists inside the computer.
* it is a group of processes, that has a group of resources, specifically assigned to it.

* here after imagining the container, for a chrome seperately, then the next step is
* kernel will look at the incoming call, and directs the process to the resources available only for this container
*to ex: hard drive, RAM,network

* now, we might have a question, that how is the image, a file contains the processes?
* ans is, the image, will have a specific start up commands , 
* first, the kernel is going to isolate  a little section of the hard drive and makes it 
    available only to  just this container
* now after this subset is created ,, the file snapshot , inside the image, is taken
     and placed inside the subset.
*  now, the startup command is then exectued, and the chrome is invoked, and we 
  create a new instance of that process, the process is then isolated inside this container
