how to make sure that package.json is available inside the container
 before npm install is executed, 

 so we need to add a instruction that is 

it is copy instruction 
it is used to move files and folders from local file system on machine 
to file system inside the temporary container that is
 created during the build process 

syntax is 

COPY ./ ./

path to tolder to copy from on *your machine*
 relative to build context (./ 
is current working directory)

place to copy stuff to insdie *the container*

now it is not good to work with image id 
so we need to work with the tag names of that image 

docker build -t username/projectname .
docker build -t rohandevaki/simpleweb .

now try to startup the image and get the node server running 

docker run image_name 
docker run rohandevaki/simpleweb
