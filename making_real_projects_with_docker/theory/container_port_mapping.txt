fixing the site cant be reached message even after running the image

our browser is making request to localhost:8080 
it is reference to current machine on port 8080

by default no traffic is coming to your localhost is routed to container 
it has its own isolated ports 

so in order to make sure that request to your computer or 
some outside computer will be redirected to conatainer
we need to setup explict port mapping 

port mapping :
anytime someone makes request to given port on local network 
take that  request and automatically forward it to some  port inside the 
container 

if anyone makes the request to localhost:8080 , take that request 
and automatically forward it to port inside the container on port 8080
where the node application can receive it and process the request

this is only talking about incoming request 
docker can also make a request 

when you run npm install ,it reaches to the internet 
so there is no limitaion on contianers avility to reach out 
it is limitaion on the incoming request on your computer to get in the container 


so inorder to forward the traffic 
we need to change the process of running the docker 

port setup is run time 
it is not any changes in dockerfile 

we need to run 
                      |- this port inside the contianer 
docker run -p 8080 : 8080 <image id>
                |
                -  route incoming requests to this port on local host to 

so first quit from the running container by ctrlC 

and then start the container back up and setup the port mapping

port from the source machine to the port we are mapping to container 
neet not be identical 

so we can say anytime request comes on 5000 redirect to  8080 on container 

and if you are trying to change the port on container , you also need to change 
on app.js 

to exit the running container , enter exit 

we need to rebuild the conatiner and then we will relaunch it

if u want to run the contianer with id 

docker ps 
docker exec -it <imageID> sh 

and program we want to run
