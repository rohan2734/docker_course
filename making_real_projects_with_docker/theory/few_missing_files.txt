* npm is included in our container, so it is 
attempting to install the dependencices 

* but it is saying that there is no package.json file  together 
* that is a file inside our project , its purpose ist to list all 
the dependencices that are required to successfully run the project 

so when we run npm install , npm finds this file, and finds all 
the dependencices and tries to install each of those 

but npm is not able to get the file 

reasons:

let us understand the execution 
insdie the image building process 

we specify  1.FROM node:alpine 
it downloads the node image 
next step 2.RUN npm install , goes back to the previous step  and get the image 
from there and create temporary container out of it 

we take the FS snapshot and put in temporary container 
and then we execute npm install 

here we dont see any package.json file available in container 
only files available is whatever came out of the FS snapshot from node image 

we are only working with segment of harddrive, there is other rest of hard drive
which is not conected to container and inside the rest of harddrive 
is where our package.json is 
so it is not able to communicate into the container 

so if we do run successfully run npm install, but there is no package.json file 
available

so takeaway is:
none of the files inside your project directory are available inside
the container by default
