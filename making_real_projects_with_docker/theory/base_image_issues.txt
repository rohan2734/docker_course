alpine doesnt have npm
there is no copy of npm available 
we have base image ,alpine 
we need to select base image, based on dependencies we want to use 
it is just a  5MB file 

1.we can find a base image that has node and npm pre installed in it 

2.alternatively we can install nodejs and npm install in alpine 

we are choosing step1

go to dockerhub, 
hub.docker.com

node : this repository has node pre installed in it 
so we can build our image based on node 

we can specift the node version 
FROM node:6.14

we want to see tag called alpine
if we see a tag called alpine
we can do 
FROM node:alpine 

here the tags are the repositories 
not FROM alpine
