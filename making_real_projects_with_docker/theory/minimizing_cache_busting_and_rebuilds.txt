we need to take current build process , 
inside the docker file and split the copy operation into 
2 different steps 

only thing npm install requires is package.json , it doesnt require about 
index.js 

so we will 
COPY ./package.json for npm install

look in the directory specified for docker build and find the 
package.json file and copy that into the current working directory  of the 
container 

then we will run npm install and we will copy everything else 

and run 
docker build -t rohandevaki/simpleweb .

so if we do this one more time 
it will run very quickly
because we are able to use the cache version 

now change the index.js file ,from bye there to how are you 
and run docker build -t rohandevaki/simpleweb . 
for 3 rd time

we saw that it is execued very quickly

so the order of instructions will make difference 
wherever possible segment out the copy instructions
