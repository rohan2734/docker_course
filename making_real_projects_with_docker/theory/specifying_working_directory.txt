need to start a shell , to do debugging inside the container 

docker run -it rohandevaki/simpleweb sh

we are overridng the default startup command to sh , to start a shell program 

we are not mentioning a port map, here to just look at the files and folders
of the conatainer

print all the available files and folders

we see that we have 
package-loc.json generated by npm 
and node_modules generated by npm 

these were all placed into the root directory
of this container 

this is not the best practice
reason: if we have any files or folders that conflict with the directory 
we may accidentally override the files in the container 

so we need to copy to the nested directory 

we can have WORKDIR /usr/app
