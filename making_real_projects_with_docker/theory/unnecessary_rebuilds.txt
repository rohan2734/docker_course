start up the container 
with docker run -p 8080:8080 rohandevaki/simpleweb

now we are trying to make changes to index.js file

so we change hi there to by there 
we saved it , but when we see in the loclahost:8080 , we arenot able to 
see the changes

anytime we build an image, we are taking snapshot of file system 
we are taking a snapshot of index.js , after it got copied over 

and we are running our application based on old version of index.js 

we modified index.js file inside our current working directory here 
that change is not going to be automatically updated on container 

if we want that update the file inside the container, we need 
to do additional file configuration

well to get the container the latest update , we need to build again 
it would do all the npm install , npm start etc

so we will stop the running server 
we will do docker build -t rohandevaki/simpleweb .

here when we run COPY ./ ./
we are copying every single file 
even though we only made changes to index.js

so that is not ideal, if we ddint make any dependency change 
we should not run a npm install command
